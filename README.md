# Python: Financial and Election Analysis

## Python For Loops 


### Task 1: PyBank Print and Export

In this activity, I was tasked with creating a Python script that will analyze the financial records of a company. With a given set of financial records I am to create a report that calculates various metrics. The dataset is provided in a .csv format and is composed of two columns: Date and Profit/Losses. The steps I took to complete the task are as follows.
* Identify the total number of months within the dataset
* Calculate the net total "Profit/Losses" over the time period
* Calculate "Profit/Loss" changes over the entire period and the average of those changes
* Calculate the maximum increase in profits and identify the date it occured
* Calculate the minimum increase in profits and identify the date it occured

### Task 2: PyPoll Print and Export

In this activity, I am tasked with assisting a small, rural town modernize its vote counting process.
With a given set of collected voter poll data, I am to create a Python script that analyzes the votes and calculates some standard voting metrics. The dataset provided in a .csv file format and is composed of three columns: Voter ID, County, and Candidate. The steps I took to complete the task are as follows.
* Find the total number of votes casted
* Compile a list of candidates who received votes
* Calculate each candidates votes received percentage
* Calculate each candidates votes received count
* Find out who the winner of the election is
